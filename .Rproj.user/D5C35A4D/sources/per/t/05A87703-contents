# Online Presentation
Hello! Welcome to my online presentation. [This](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032707000894?via%3Dihub) is the paper we will review. 
---
# Summary
Chronic pain is complex to approach from a cognitive and emotional perspective. Due to the long exposure to pain, patients usually process information differently by applying a harmful connotation to mostly all signals.

In regards to language, it has been hypothesize that a constant fear to pain would lead into a continued emotional processing of all words. This has been studied using EEG methods.
---
# Summary
The study reviews IF...

- chronic pain patients identify a greater number of words as pain-related (sensory and affective pain descriptors) through a self-endorsement task.

- the processing of those words is similar to non-emotion words processing through electroencephalogram (EEG) recording.

According to the literature they present, their chronic pain participants would show increased behavioral responses (more words as pain descriptors, longer RTs) and reduced brain responses compared to healthy controls (HC).
---
# Participants
Their participants included:

- 36 chronic pain patients (a group with fibromyalgia (FM, *n* = 18), and a group with other identifiable physical injuries such as arthritis (MSK, *n* = 18))

- 16 HC

üëÄ The types of chronic pain patients is relevant for the results section.
---
# Methods
## Self-Endorsement Task
Chronic pain patients and HC had to decide whether the word that appeared on the screen was a sensory/affective pain descriptor or not (YES vs NO decision). HC were asked to think about a painful experience while completing the task.

The words included could be:

**Sensory pain descriptors:** *fearful, nauseating*

**Affective pain descriptors:** *sharp, burning*

**Non-pain-related words** *beautiful, friendly*
---
# Methods
## EEG Recording
Brain activity was recorded using an low-density net, 32-channel system.
---
# Methods
## Self-Report Measures
Participants also completed written psychological questionnaires:

- Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory
- Beck Depression Inventory
- McGrill Pain Questionnaire
- West Haven-Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory
- Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire
- Pain Axiety Symptoms Scale
- Pain Vigilance and Awareness Questionnaire
---
# Explanation of Behavioral Analysis
The researchers obtained:

- the percentage of "yes" and "no" answers

- the average RT

for each word type and each participant.

Then, they used a *Word* x *Response* x *Group* mixed-model repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA)
---
# Explanation of EEG Analysis
EEG segments were analyzed with pre-processing procedures, which included:

- averaging
- filtering
- artifacts detection
- baseline correction

"ERP amplitudes were examined in a *Brain region* (frontal, central, centro-parietal, temporo-parietal,parietal and occipital) x *Hemisphere* (left versus right) x *Word* (sensory, unpleasant, pleasant words) x *Group*
(FM, MSK, healthy controls) mixed-model repeated measures ANOVA."
---
# Appropriateness/novelty of Analysis
When adding an extra layer to an experiment, such as eye-tracking or EEG, the researchers have to think about statistical procedure three times:

1) How to analyze the behavioral results?

2) How to analyze the (here) EEG results?

3) How to combine both types of results?

It seems understandable to look for an interaction of the variables they suggest.
---
# Appropriateness/novelty of Analysis
Sitges et al. (2007) used ANOVAs, common in the field **and** it is a statistical method that we have reviewed together.

ANOVAs are used to understand the interaction of multiple variables across groups. Here we have three groups, so ANOVAs will help to understand their relationship and its statistical significance. 

Other statistical methods would provide different perspectives. Given what we have learned in class, using the GLM seems like a good choice as well.
---
# Results
The results are divided in four sections:

a) Clinical and sociodemographic characteristics

b) Number of self-endorsed words

c) Reaction times to self-endorsed words

d) Event-related potentials to self-endorsed words
---
# Results
## Clinical and Sociodemographic Characteristics
The article includes another ANOVA based on two?/four? of the different psychological questionnaires, although they did not mention it before. It does not explain what variables are considered in this ANOVA.

The article reports t-test results.

Clinical and sociodemographic results are included in a table (long table, it takes more than one page!). It is easy to read.
---
# Results
## Number of Self-Endorsed Words
The article shares these results using percentages. This sections includes an explanation of the interactions among the variables and the results for each group by reporting F-statistic, degrees of freedom, p values and the Greenhouse-Geisse correction (personally, I've only seen this one in EEG papers).
---
# Results
## Number of Self-Endorsed Words
This figure shows the % of YES responses per word type and group.

# Results
## RT to Self-Endorsed Words
This section is similar to the previous one in terms of what they report and explain. The article includes the same statistic information and guides the reader through the comparisons between groups.
---
# Results
## RT to Self-Endorsed Words
There is a figure for this section as well, this time reporting the RT per word type and per group for both YES and NO answers.

This is the figure for YES answers.
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "75%"
#| dpi: 400
#| fig.align: "center"
knitr::include_graphics(here("figs", "fig2.png"))
```

# Results
## RT to Self-Endorsed Words
And this is the figure for NO answers.
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "75%"
#| dpi: 400
#| fig.align: "center"
knitr::include_graphics(here("figs", "fig3.png"))
```

# Results
## ERPs to Self-Endorsed Words
The article starts this part by explaining the figure below. It illustrates the grand averages of ERPs by group and by word type.
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "75%"
#| dpi: 400
#| fig.align: "center"
knitr::include_graphics(here("figs", "fig4.png"))
```
---
# Results
## ERPs to Self-Endorsed Words
Then, ERPs waveforms are analyzed for two different components: P200 and late positive complex (LPC). For both of them, the information analyzed is based on amplitude.

In the case of P200, the analysis reports again the results of statistic tests. Aside of interaction differences between groups, this section includes the differences between brain regions (it was included in the ANOVA).
---
# Results
## ERPs to Self-Endorsed Words
This is the figure included for the P200 results.
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "75%"
#| dpi: 400
#| fig.align: "center"
knitr::include_graphics(here("figs", "fig5.png"))
```
---
# Results
## ERPs to Self-Endorsed Words
For the LPC, the analysis is similar.

This is the figure included for the LPC results.
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "75%"
#| dpi: 400
#| fig.align: "center"
knitr::include_graphics(here("figs", "fig6.png"))
```

# Analysis Assessment
Reading the article and carefully going through the analysis and results helps to understand the findings better.

The article seemed complex at first (a lot of consider), but in the end everything was reduced to ANOVAs and different combination of variables.

‚úÖ Plots made it easier to understand the results.

‚ùì Why is there no consistency among them (some report YES responses, others YES and NO)?
---
# Analysis Assessment
Some considerations...
- The article failed to report that they were going to run an extra ANOVA for the psychological questionnaires AND did not mention them in their discussion. It could have been assessed better and used as a relevant factor.
---
# Analysis Assessment
Some considerations on EEG...
- Many details are not reported in the methodology or not included at all in the article. Some of those, like the time window of interest or what component does the study focus in are commonly included and carefully analyzed.

- My guess is that the researchers either failed to report those details. The data included can not be obtain without thinking about the analysis prior of collecting data.
---
# Analysis Assessment
Some considerations...
- The article does not report how was any of the statistic information obtained. Did the researches use R? Any special package? Did they do it with any other programming tool or without one at all?

- The article does not share code nor data. This study would not be replicable nor meets the standards to be consider reliable (probably a strong statement, but probably true).
